### General Info:
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************
This Website page showcases the To-Do Application. In this project I have used HTML - CSS - JS. It is commonly required application for everyday use. Keeping it simple to add new To-do task, deleting the Done tasks with Clear All function and retaining the task after refresh via local storage. You can enable the Add ("+") button only after writing in input box. You can enable Clear All task only after a pending task is present. The delete button is displayed only on hover of specific task. You can also see the count of pending tasks at footer.

A To-Do App is a task management app to help you stay organized and manage your day-to-day. It is handy to keep track of tasks to complete it accordingly. In future, more functionality like Alarm/Reminder, Take Notes, Shopping List, etc.
